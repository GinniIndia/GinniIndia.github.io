        <h3>Scientist ‘B’ (Senior Software Engineer) @ CDOT, Delhi (April 2024 - Present)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Three Factor OAuth Service: Developed a scalable Microservice from scratch based on three factor of authentication JWT, TOTP and Digital Signature. Involves Client registration, Users registration, Locking User, Ngnix Gateway, HTTPs for SSL/TLS. Further app is deployed over K8, with pvc logging, autoscaling / load balancing using hpa. PVC storage never be full with logging as deletion of logs will follow automatically using FIFO after reaching defined threshold 80-90% of PVC storage space.
Tech Used : Flask, Docker, MySQL, K8, PVC, Ngnix, HTTPs, Ingress, Encryption using RSA.</li>
          <li>Open Source Key Management System (KMS): Lead end-to-end KMS solutiong using Keycloak as User Mangement and Hashicorp Vault as Secret Key Manager. System involves three microservices, one is wrapper microservice to have single point of access to both keycloak and hashicorp-vault microservice resp. Two Factor Authentication using JWT and TOTP. Data can be stored from files or any other text in HashiCorp Vault as secret. PVC storage never be full with logging as deletion of logs will follow automatically using FIFO after reaching defined threshold 80-90% of PVC storage space. Two type of users “Admin and Normal Users”, where admin users can do read/write both while normal users can do only read operations. Used Hashicorp Vault for secret storage as its more secure becoz of encryption compare to secrets of K8 which are simply base64 encoded.
       Tech Used : Flask, Docker, MySQL, K8, PVC, Ngnix, HTTPs, Ingress, Hashicorp Vault, Keycloak.</li>
          <li>Call Data Records (CDR): Project involves extracting all call histories for mobile number for a given time period. CDR works as middle software between client and TSP. All data is kept as encrypted. Self Designed SSLRestTemplate for HTTPs for client end. Enabled Authentication using AES 256 bits encryption and Hashing validation. Setup entire Testing Setup of CDR.
       Tech Used : Java Spring, MySQL, K8, PVC, Ngnix, HTTPs, Ingress, Encryption using AES.</li>
          <li>Search Engine - Developed a question answering system over provided data using RAG Pipeline, NLP, LLM. App is deployed over Hugging Faces Spaces.
       Tech Used : Streamlit, Python, Hugging Face Spaces, T-5 model, FAISS.</li>
          <li>
